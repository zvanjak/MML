# Vector types

## Defined vector types

Basic types representing vectors:
- [Vector\<class T>](/docs/base/Vector.md) - vector with run-time defined size
- [VectorN\<class T, int N>](/docs/base/VectorN.md) - vector with compile-time defined size

Specialized types of VectorN class:
- Vector2Cartesian
- Vector2Polar
- Vector3Cartesian
- Vector3Spherical
- Vector3Cyllindrical
